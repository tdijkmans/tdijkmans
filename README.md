### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Thomas. I recently graduated at Codaisseur's Academy (Amsterdam) as Fullstack Developer. If you want to check out my projects, great! - have a look at my repositories and I recommend you visit [âœ¨Savoristasâœ¨ ](https://savoristas.netlify.app/). It's 'a Social Network for Flavor Combinations' in the making.

On your left hand, you see a number of coding skills I have. JavaScript and Python are my languages so far. ðŸ’¬

ðŸ”­ Currently I am looking for an opportunity, to code, to learn, to laugh.
ðŸ“« Do reach out to me if you want to talk!
