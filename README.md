Hi, I'm Thomas. I recently graduated at Codaisseur's Academy Amsterdam as _Fullstack Developer_. If you want to check out my projects, great! - have a look at my repositories and I recommend you visit [âœ¨Savoristasâœ¨ ](https://savoristas.netlify.app/). It's 'a Social Network for Flavor Combinations' in the making.

ðŸ‘ˆ There, you see a number of coding skills I have. JavaScript and Python are my languages so far.

ðŸ”­ Currently _I am looking for a junior opportunity_ to code, to deliver, to learn and to laugh.
Do reach out to me if you want to talk! â˜•â˜•
